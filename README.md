 # Modal Manager
### Key Points
- It seems likely that your configuration object will work with a custom modal library, supporting dynamic creation, AJAX content loading, and nested modals up to three levels, which is deeper than typical systems.
- Research suggests the library can handle form submission, refresh on close, and back navigation, given the implementation details.
- The evidence leans toward the library being compatible with Bootstrap, but custom styling is also supported if Bootstrap is not included.

### Direct Answer

Your configuration object is designed to create a modal with advanced features, and it should work well with a custom modal library. Here's how it fits:

#### Configuration Overview
The object will create a modal titled "Dynamic Modal", large size (`lg`), with a form for submission and content loaded from [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1). It includes nested modals like "Open New Modal 1" and "Open New Modal 2", going up to three levels, which is more depth than usual for modal systems, enhancing user interaction.

#### Functionality
The library likely handles:
- **Form Submission**: Your modal includes a form with a "Save Changes" button.
- **AJAX Loading**: It fetches content dynamically, showing a loading state before displaying the data beautifully.
- **Nested Modals**: Supports opening modals within modals, with proper layering and blur effects on previous ones.
- **Refresh on Close**: When a nested modal closes, the previous modal can refresh its content, useful for updating dashboards.
- **Back Navigation**: Nested modals with `backArrow: true` likely include a back button to navigate to the previous modal.

#### Styling and Compatibility
The library checks for Bootstrap; if included (e.g., via `<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">`), it uses Bootstrap styles for a polished look. If not, it falls back to custom styling with animations like fade-in, ensuring responsiveness on different devices.

This setup works for standalone HTML projects or frameworks like Laravel, with easy integration via asset compilation.

### Comprehensive Implementation of the Custom Modal Library

This section provides a detailed analysis and implementation of a custom modal library based on the user's provided configuration and documentation, ensuring all functionalities are supported with 25 example use cases and compatibility with Bootstrap or custom styling.

#### Modal System Analysis

The user's configuration object includes a complex setup for a dynamic modal, with features like form submission, AJAX content loading, and nested modals up to three levels. Below is a breakdown of the requirements and their implementation:

| **Feature**                     | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Modal Stack Management           | Tracks open modals, applies blur to previous ones, and manages z-index, supporting up to three levels of nesting. |
| Global Styles Addition           | Ensures styles are added once, handling blur and z-index dynamically, with custom or Bootstrap classes. |
| Open/Close Mechanism             | Includes `showModal`, `hideModal`, and `closeAllModals` for modal management, with smooth transitions. |
| Dynamic Modal Creation           | Creates modals programmatically with customizable options, including AJAX and form submission. |
| AJAX Content Loading             | Loads content dynamically from URLs, with loading states ("Loading...") and error handling ("Error loading content"). |
| Close All Modals Option          | Adds a button to close all modals at once, useful for clearing multiple dialogs. |
| Nested Modals Support            | Allows opening modals inside other modals, with recursive support up to three levels, as seen in the user's configuration. |
| Previous Modal Refresh on Close  | Refreshes the previous modal's content when a nested modal closes, if `bodyContentRefreshCloseModal` is true. |
| Multiple Modal Blur Handling     | Applies blur to previous modals based on stack order, not the entire background, ensuring focus on the topmost modal. |
| Customization Options            | Supports themes (e.g., dark mode), animations (e.g., fade-in), and button styles for flexible styling. |

The user's configuration fits into this system, particularly as a "Nested Modal Example" and "AJAX Loaded Content Modal", with additional features like form submission and refresh on close.

#### Implementation Details

The library is implemented using a `Modal` class for individual modal instances and a `ModalManager` class for global management. Below are the key components:

##### Modal Class
- **Constructor**: Initializes with options, generates a unique ID (e.g., `modal-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`), and creates the modal DOM structure. It merges default options with user-provided ones, supporting properties like `title`, `size`, `submitForm`, `loadContentUrl`, and `showOpenAgain`.
- **Methods**:
  - `create()`: Builds the modal with overlay, content, and close button. If `submitForm` is true, wraps content in a `<form>`. Handles `backArrow` by adding a back button if true and there are previous modals in the stack. Adds buttons from `showOpenAgain` for nested modals, ensuring recursive support up to three levels.
  - `updateStack()`: Manages z-index (starting at 1000, incrementing by stack length) and applies `.modal-blur` to previous modals for stacking, ensuring the topmost modal is interactive.
  - `close()`: Removes the modal from DOM, updates the stack, and if `bodyContentRefreshCloseModal` is true, calls `refreshContent()` on the previous modal in the stack, enhancing user interaction by updating dashboards or forms.
  - `refreshContent()`: Fetches content from `loadContentUrl` using `fetch`, showing "Loading..." initially, then updates the modal body with the response or an error message, supporting AJAX loading with loading states and error handling.
  - `setContent()`: Updates the modal body, preserving form structure if `submitForm` is true, ensuring dynamic content updates work seamlessly.

##### ModalManager Class
- **Static Methods**:
  - `createModal(options)`: Creates a new `Modal` instance with the provided options, sets its z-index to 1000 + stack length, blurs the previous modal if any, and returns the instance for further manipulation, ensuring proper layering.
  - `closeTop()`: Closes the topmost modal in the stack, removing blur from the new top modal and refreshing its content if the closed modal had `bodyContentRefreshCloseModal` set to true, returning a boolean indicating success.
  - `closeAllModals()`: Closes all open modals, clearing the stack, and returns `true`, useful for clearing multiple dialogs at once.
  - `getById(id)`: Retrieves a modal instance by ID from the stack, returning `undefined` if not found, supporting modal instance retrieval.
  - `getAll()`: Returns an object mapping IDs to modal instances, reflecting all open modals, enhancing modal management.

##### Style Handling
- The library checks for Bootstrap via `typeof bootstrap !== 'undefined'`. If present, it uses Bootstrap classes (`modal`, `modal-dialog`, etc.) and initializes with `bootstrap.Modal`, ensuring a polished look. If not, it applies custom classes (`modal-wrapper`, `modal-content`, etc.) with fallback styling in `styles.css`, supporting custom styling if Bootstrap is not included.
- Custom styles include animations (fade-in, slide-in) via CSS `@keyframes`, responsive design with media queries for mobile (e.g., `max-width: 90%` at 600px), and themes like dark mode with `.dark-mode` class, ensuring a beautiful display with shadows, rounded corners, and animations.

##### AJAX Content Loading
- Uses `fetch` for AJAX requests, displaying a loading state ("Loading...") with a spinner in the modal body, handles errors by showing "Error loading content", and supports `method`, `csrfOption`, and `data` for advanced requests, though the user's configuration uses GET by default, ensuring dynamic content loading with loading states and error handling.

##### Nested Modals
- Implemented via `showOpenAgain`, where each object in the array becomes a button in the footer. Clicking the button creates a new modal with the nested configuration, recursively handling further `showOpenAgain` properties, supporting up to three levels as seen in the user's configuration (main -> New Modal 1 -> New Modal 1/New Modal 2), ensuring proper z-index stacking and blur effects on previous modals.

##### Refresh on Close
- When `bodyContentRefreshCloseModal: true`, the `close()` method checks the stack and calls `refreshContent()` on the previous modal, ensuring updated content like dashboards or forms reflect changes from nested interactions, enhancing user interaction.

#### 25 Example Use Cases

The library supports 25 use cases, each demonstrated with a button in `index.html`. Below is the expanded list, including the user's configuration as one of the examples:

The user's configuration is included as part of examples 6 (Nested Modal Example) and 7 (AJAX Loaded Content Modal), with additional features like form submission and refresh on close, fitting seamlessly into the library's capabilities.

#### Bootstrap and Custom Styling Integration

- **Bootstrap Detection**: The library checks for Bootstrap via `typeof bootstrap !== 'undefined'`. If present, it uses Bootstrap classes (`modal`, `modal-dialog`, etc.) and initializes with `bootstrap.Modal`, ensuring a polished look. If not, it applies custom classes (`modal-wrapper`, `modal-content`, etc.) with fallback styling in `styles.css`, supporting custom styling if Bootstrap is not included.
- **Responsive Design**: Modals are responsive, with max-width adjustments for mobile devices (e.g., `max-width: 90%` at 600px) and animations like fade-in for a smooth user experience, ensuring beautiful display on various screen sizes.
- **Beautiful Display**: Custom styles include shadows, rounded corners, and animations, while Bootstrap enhances the look with its polished UI components, ensuring a visually appealing display with animations and responsiveness.

#### Example Usage and Implementation

To test, save the files in a directory and open `index.html` in a browser. Click the buttons to see each example in action, including the user's configuration via the "Open Nested Modal" and "Open AJAX Modal" buttons. For Laravel integration, compile assets with Laravel Mix and include them in Blade templates:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('css/styles.css') }}">
<script src="{{ asset('js/modal.js') }}"></script>
```

The library is designed for both standalone HTML projects and frameworks, with easy integration via asset compilation, ensuring it works seamlessly in various environments, supporting up to three levels of nested modals, which is deeper than typical systems, enhancing user interaction.
